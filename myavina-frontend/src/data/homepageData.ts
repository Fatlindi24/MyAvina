  {
    question: "What is bioidentical HRT?",
    answer: "Bioidentical Hormone Replacement Therapy (BHRT) uses hormones that are molecularly identical to those the human body produces. They are derived from plant sources and are designed to restore hormonal balance in the most natural way possible."
  },
  {
    question: "How safe is HRT? What are the risks?",
    answer: "For most healthy women, the benefits of modern, FDA-approved HRT outweigh the risks, especially when started within 10 years of menopause. Your MyAvina physician will conduct a thorough review of your medical history to ensure it's a safe option for you."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need blood or saliva hormone testing?",
    answer: "No, current guidelines from major medical societies (like NAMS) do not recommend routine hormone testing to diagnose perimenopause or menopause. Treatment is based on your symptoms, and your physician will work with you to find the right dosage."
  },
  {
    question: "Will MyAvina work for me in perimenopause?",
    answer: "Yes, MyAvina provides treatments that are effective for managing the symptoms of both perimenopause and menopause. Many women start experiencing symptoms years before their last period, and our physicians can help."
  },
  {
    question: "How soon will I see improvements after starting my treatment?",
    answer: "While individual results vary, many women report feeling improvements in symptoms like hot flashes and sleep within a few weeks. It can take up to three months to feel the full effects as your body adjusts."
  },
  {
    question: "Will HRT help me manage menopausal weight gain?",
    answer: "Hormonal changes during menopause can contribute to weight gain, particularly around the abdomen. By restoring hormonal balance, HRT can help manage these changes, making it easier to maintain a healthy weight with diet and exercise."
  },
  {
    question: "How does MyAvina compare to an in-person visit?",
    answer: "MyAvina offers the same high standard of care from board-certified physicians but with added convenience. You can access care from home, avoid travel and waiting rooms, and have ongoing support through our platform, all at an affordable price."
